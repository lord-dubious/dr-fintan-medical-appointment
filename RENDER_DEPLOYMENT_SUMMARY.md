## Service Worker Authentication Fixes

### Enhanced Fetch Requests
Fixed the appointment-related fetch requests in `public/sw-enhanced.js` (lines 414-440) to include:

#### Authentication Headers Added
- `X-CSRF-TOKEN`: CSRF protection token
- `Authorization`: Bearer token for API authentication
- `Accept`: JSON response format specification
- `Content-Type`: JSON content type

#### New Helper Functions
1. **getCSRFToken()**: Retrieves CSRF token from Sanctum endpoint or IndexedDB cache
2. **getAuthToken()**: Gets authentication token from IndexedDB or cookies
3. **getCookies()**: Parses cookies from API responses (service worker compatible)

### Affected Endpoints
- `POST /api/appointments` (book-appointment)
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}` (update-appointment)
- `DELETE /api/appointments/{id}` (cancel-appointment)

## Deployment Benefits

### Reliability
- Comprehensive cron job coverage for all maintenance tasks
- Proper database connections across all services
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### Security
- CSRF protection on all API calls
- Bearer token authentication
- Secure cookie handling

### Performance
- Optimized reminder frequency (every 2 hours vs hourly)
- Regular cache clearing and optimization
- Log file cleanup to prevent disk space issues

### Maintenance
- Automated database backups
- Queue management and cleanup
- Failed job pruning

## Environment Variables Required

Set these in your Render dashboard:
- `NOTIFICATION_API_CLIENT_ID`
- `NOTIFICATION_API_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated configuration to Render
2. Set the required environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Monitor the cron jobs and queue worker performance
4. Test the enhanced service worker authentication
5. Verify database backups are working correctly
